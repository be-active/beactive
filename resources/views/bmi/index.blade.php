				<strong> Body Mass Index </strong> is a calculation that takes into consideration both a person's body weight and height to determine whether they are underweight, overweight, or at a healthy weight.
				<br>BMI applies to adult men and women and  Itâ€™s useful to know because if your weight increases or decreases outside of the ideal range, your health risks may increase.
